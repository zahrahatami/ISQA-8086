# Problems:
### Zoop-temp:
* Not reliable data analysis: the is the statistical analysis that calculated manually instead of using excel formula to track the columns   and math calculation.
### Pond:
* Missing Data
* confusing data indicator, for example "z" is the name of one column which is hard to understand what is stand for?
* No unit for rational data
### Zoop-temp-main:
* Missing Data
* Unstaible data: there is a star" in column "TEMP", row "23" that effects the value of the data.
* The garph does not have title and unit in vertical axis.
### All Data Sets:
* confusing data entry: there is different color for the data which make reader to be confused.
* The data did not show which data set is reffering to night and which one reffering to morning collection.


# System Sugestion:

* This organization can use data collection system(DCS) which is computer application system. DCS is work as data collection system that collect structured information which has to be gathered systematically. This organization with using this system can perform data analysis technique too. DCS will check data regarding data validation, documentation for the data and also it is contain full details information about the data. 
*  the tables is represented different columns the same as columns in three different data sets except adding time column ad also species column can take care of different species so i deleted the columns titles the name of species.
