# Problems:
### Zoop-temp:
* Not reliable data analysis: the is the statistical analysis that calculated manually instead of using excel formula to track the columns  and math calculation.
### Pond:
* Missing Data
* confusing data indicator, for example, "z" is the name of one column which is hard to understand what is stand for?
* No unit for rational data
### Zoop-temp-main:
* Missing Data
* Unstable data: there is a star" in column "TEMP", row "23" that affects the value of the data.
* The graph does not have title and unit on the vertical axis.
### All Data Sets:
* confusing data entry: there is the different color for the data which make the reader to be confused.
* The data did not show which data set is referring to night and which one referring to morning collection.


# System Sugestion:

* This organization can use data collection system(DCS) which is computer application system. DCS is work as data collection system that collect structured information which has to be gathered systematically. This organization with using this system can perform data analysis technique too. DCS will check data regarding data validation, documentation for the data and also it is contain full details information about the data. If there is missing data, DCS will make notification or stop the processing in this step.
 
*  the tables is represented different columns the same as columns in three different data sets except adding time column which will collect the time for the entry data and so it will be obvious which data is related to night and which one is for morning. and also species column can take care of different species so i deleted the columns titles the name of species.
