# Problems:
### Zoop-temp:
* Not reliable data analysis: there is the statistical analysis that calculated manually instead of using excel formula to track the columns and math calculation.
### Pond:
* Missing Data
* confusing data indicator, for example, "z" is the name of one column which is hard to understand what is stand for?
* No unit for rational data
* Unit did not availabile in dataset, for example temperature refer to Celsius or Farrenheit!
### Zoop-temp-main:
* Missing Data
* Unstable data: there is a "star" in column "TEMP", row "23" that affects the value of the data.
* The graph does not have title and unit on the vertical axis.
### All Data Sets:
* confusing data entry: there is the different color for the data which make the readers to be confused.
* The data did not show which data set is referring to night and which one referring to morning collection.


# System Sugestion:

* This organization can use data collection system(DCS) for gathering and organizing the data. DCS is work as data collection system that collects structured information systematically. This organization with using this system can perform data analysis technique. DCS will check data regarding data validation, documentation for the data and also it contains full details information about the data. If there is missing data, DCS will make notification or stop the processing in following steps.
 
* The template table is represented columns the same as the original table but carrying the unit for data in all different data sets. Also, in this template "time" is adding for the purpose of collecting the time for the entry data to show the data related to night and the morning. The species column can take care of different species so I deleted the columns titles the name of species.
